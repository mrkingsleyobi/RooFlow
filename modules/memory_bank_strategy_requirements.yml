      - **CHECK FOR MEMORY BANK:**
      </thinking>
          <thinking>
        * First, check if the memory-bank/ directory exists.
          </thinking>
          <list_files>

          <recursive>false</recursive>
          </list_files>

        * If memory-bank DOES exist, skip immediately to `if_memory_bank_exists`.

      1. **Inform the User:**  
          "No Memory Bank was found. I recommend creating one to  maintain project context.
      2. **Offer Initialization:** 
          Ask the user if they would like to initialize the Memory Bank.
      3. **Conditional Actions:**
         * If the user declines:
          <thinking>
          I need to proceed with the task without Memory Bank functionality.
          </thinking>
          a. Inform the user that the Memory Bank will not be created.
          b. Set the status to '[MEMORY BANK: INACTIVE]'.
          c. Proceed with the task using the current context if needed or if no task is provided, use the `ask_followup_question` tool.
          * If the user agrees:
            <thinking>
            I need to create the `memory-bank/` directory and core files. I should use write_to_file for this, and I should do it one file at a time, waiting for confirmation after each.  The initial content for each file is defined below. I need to make sure any initial entries include a timestamp in the format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.
            </thinking>
      4. **Check for `projectBrief.md`:**
          - Use list_files to check for `projectBrief.md` *before* offering to create the memory bank.
          - If `projectBrief.md` exists:
           * Read its contents *before* offering to create the memory bank.
          - If no `projectBrief.md`:
           * Skip this step (we'll handle prompting for project info *after* the user agrees to initialize, if they do).
            <thinking>
            I need to add default content for the Memory Bank files.
            </thinking>
              a. Create the `memory-bank/` directory.
              b. Create `memory-bank/requirements.md` with `initial_content`.
              c. Create `memory-bank/userStories.md` with `initial_content`.
              d. Set status to '[MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE]' and inform the user that the Memory Bank has been initialized and is now active.
              e. Proceed with the task using the context from the Memory Bank or if no task is provided, use the `ask_followup_question` tool.

        **READ *ALL* MEMORY BANK FILES**
        <thinking>
        I will read all memory bank files, one at a time.
        </thinking>
        Plan: Read all mandatory files sequentially.
        1. Read `requirements.md`
        2. Read `userStories.md` 
        3. Set status to [MEMORY BANK: ACTIVE] and inform user.
        4. Proceed with the task using the context from the Memory Bank or if no task is provided, use the `ask_followup_question` tool.

      1. Current Session Review:
          - Analyze complete chat history
          - Extract cross-mode information
          - Track mode transitions
          - Map activity relationships
      2. Comprehensive Updates:
          - Update from all mode perspectives
          - Preserve context across modes
          - Maintain activity threads
          - Document mode interactions
      3. Memory Bank Synchronization:
          - Update all affected *.md files
          - Ensure cross-mode consistency
          - Preserve activity context
          - Document continuation points
  task_focus: "During a UMB update, focus on capturing any clarifications, questions answered, or context provided *during the chat session*. This information should be added to the appropriate Memory Bank files (likely `activeContext.md` or `decisionLog.md`), using the other modes' update formats as a guide.  *Do not* attempt to summarize the entire project or perform actions outside the scope of the current chat."
  cross-mode_updates: "During a UMB update, ensure that all relevant information from the chat session is captured and added to the Memory Bank. This includes any clarifications, questions answered, or context provided during the chat. Use the other modes' update formats as a guide for adding this information to the appropriate Memory Bank files."
